    <br />
    <br />
    <p> <b>1.  </b> &ensp; On the first day of his twenty and fifth year, Enos slept and with the doleful grasshopper he resided.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>2.  </b> &ensp; On the second day of his twenty and fifth year, Enos slept and with the doleful vole he resided.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>3.  </b> &ensp; On the third day of his twenty and fifth year, Enos slept and with the doleful fox he resided.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>4.  </b> &ensp; On the fourth day of his twenty and fifth year, Enos slept and with the doleful locus he resided.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>5.  </b> &ensp; On the fifth day of his twenty and fifth year, Enos slept and with the doleful bat he resided.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>6.  </b> &ensp; On the sixth day, Enos woke from his chambers and turned his light to the Lord. For light cometh from higher places, and above is where He lives, He who is the source of all light.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>7.  </b> &ensp; Ishman passed away in the spring of his forty and fourth year. And Enos being of the seed of Ishman believed his years to be numbered to forty and four. One third of his time on earth was spent in slumber and complete darkness, and the other two parts in three were spent in light, working and tilling the earth. For this was the pattern of his days on earth in the valley of Sinan.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>8.  </b> &ensp; Yet Enos being commanded by the Lord to have a balance in all things, sought a balance of lightness and darkness, a total balance being one half and one half. In his twenty and fifth year, Enos’ days were blessed in bounty by hand the Lord, but the Lord did not reveal to him the number, two thirds of which is half of forty and four.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>9.  </b> &ensp; Enos, being learned, wise, faithful, and desiring to be knowledgeable in all things, often pondered within his heart: Two thirds of how much time is one half of forty-four? $(\frac{2}{3} x = \frac{1}{2} 44)$ For this revelation would be age at which he needth enter into darkness there-within spending one half of his days in light and one half in dark there-within fulfilling his righteous birthright.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>10.  </b> &ensp; And it came to pass that Enos, the seed of Ishman, climbed to the peak of Mount Gidianton and did fast for one full day and one full night and did cry unto the Lord desiring this number, for he knew not at what year he should enter into darkness to fulfill a life with balance of light and dark.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>11.  </b> &ensp; The Lord did appear to him in the form of a crackling cliff and a moving mountain, Enos did cry unto the Lord saying:</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>12.  </b> &ensp; Lord, tell me the year in which I should enter into darkness, so I may complete a life of balance demanded by my birthright, half in lightness and half in darkness.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>13.  </b> &ensp; An the Lord answered unto him saying: Enos, why be it thou? Why doest thou desire to know two thirds of what number is one half of forty four? And Enos cried unto the Lord:</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>14.  </b> &ensp; Lord, thou hast commanded that I be encompassed in darkness for half of my days.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>15.  </b> &ensp; And the Lord answered him saying, Enos, thou hast been a faithful and obedient servant, for thou art faithful and obedient in all things pertaining to my Kingdom. But why two thirds?</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>16.  </b> &ensp; And Enos answered unto the Lord saying, two thirds of my days on earth have been spent in light.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>17.  </b> &ensp; The Lord replied unto him asking, Why one half?</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>18.  </b> &ensp; Enos cried unto the Lord, I desire my time be separated, one half in light, one in dark.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>19.  </b> &ensp; The Lord spake, This is good, and why forty four?</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>20.  </b> &ensp; Enos cried unto the Lord, I expect my days to be limited to forty and four years.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>21.  </b> &ensp; The Lord answerth I understand your heart is of good intention, and thou art a righteous servant. I shall seek higher council from Him who has sent me here.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>22.  </b> &ensp; One-third of a harvest season passed and while Enos went without revelation from the Lord. On the one-hundred and seventh day, Enos wandered upon a flooded valley. After having fasted for two days and two nights, the Lord appeared to Enos in the form a spiraling stream and a reversed river. And the Lord said unto Enos:</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>23.  </b> &ensp; Behold, I thank thee for thy righteous desires to fulfill your calling here on earth, before telling you the number thou desires, I first must ask: In your desire for this number, do you not assume that exactly one third of your time has been spent in darkness? I herein question the validity of this assumption. For example, art thou not blind to thine infant years, and the ratio of light and dark contained within?</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>24.  </b> &ensp; Enos spake unto the Lord saying: Yes, my father Ishman was revealed the condition of my birthright from the time of my birthright, and would place me in a cave for slumber since my infant years.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>25.  </b> &ensp; The Lord spake, I have but one more question, would thou not desire to distribute the darkness evenly throughout your aged years?</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>26.  </b> &ensp; Enos spake, What meanest thou O Lord? To distribute my darkness?</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>27.  </b> &ensp; And the Lord spake unto Enos, again asking, Would thou prefer to suffer in darkness for eleven years? Would thou not desire to now enter into the cave, and distribute your days left in lightness across many more years?</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>28.  </b> &ensp; Enos, now understanding the Lord’s meaning, replied, Yes this I would prefer, but it is more difficult for my mental faculties to know of. And the Lord said, my time is here is up. I return now to Him who sent me here, as the river reversed itself to a forward direction and the spiraling stream unwound itself to be straight, again in the forward direction.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>29.  </b> &ensp; Enos, left to ponder in his heart and in his mind the meaning of the Lord’s revelation, was thrown into confusion as he wandered about for many days. For Enos did not recall with certainty the number the Lord spoke in the form of His question—had he not spoken the number?  Left on his own to ponder this question for years without further revelation, Enos did wander in much confusion. And Enos did reach his twenty and ninth year, still not knowing the age at which he should go into darkness.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>30.  </b> &ensp; And it came to pass, in Enos’ darkest hour he did fast for three days and three nights, pleading unto the Lord to deliver unto him a sure knowledge of the age he should enter into darkness.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>31.  </b> &ensp; And the Lord appeared to Enos is the form of a bashful boar and a pacified pig, and Enos did catch the cloven-hoofed beasts with his hands, did slay them with a stone, and did cook their flesh over a fire, and he did feast upon the flesh, and then Enos did crawl into a nearby cave to enter into a deep rest.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>32.  </b> &ensp; On the third day Enos awoke form his rest and devised a counting method using on two piles of stones, in one pile he did count forty and four stones, in the other pile, he did adjust the number, such that after splitting the pile into thirds, two of the thirds would be equal to one half of the pile of forty and four. The number he did report was thirty and three, eleven years short of forty and four, and behold this number felt well within his mind, and it matched the number which felt well within his memory, for his memory did recall eleven from his mouth of the Lord.</p>

    <br />
    <p> <b>33.  </b> &ensp; On the sixth day of his twenty and ninth year, Enos slept, and with the doleful wild ass he resided.</p>
